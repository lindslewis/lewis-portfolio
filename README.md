# lewis-portfolio

## Description
This page is a self-drafted porfolio, providing information about me-- Lindsay Lewis, links to my various projects, and navigation to methods of contact. In this page, users will find anchor links in the header that will link them to the related section on the page. They will find images that are being used as links to my projects, and at the bottom, they will find an anchor link to bring them back to the top of the page.

## Usage
This webpage is primarily for the use of myself to display projects that I have worked on. Page visitors will be able to peruse my works that are available to view in the center of the page, and also follow the links at the bottom of the page within the "Contact Me" section in order to see who I am, my Github repos, LinkedIn, and other profiles to further their understanding of who I am.

## Features
This webpage utilizes the following features:
Anchor links to deploy to various parts of the webpage itself.
Links to other sites that deploy in new tabs.
Attempted to use media queries in order to make the page adapt to screen size changes (much needed development needs to happen here, as I still do not understand how this works, somehow my footer keeps ending up at the top of the page when this is put into action).

## Lessons-Learned
This project has been quite the undertaking for me as a brand new developer. While I have far to go, the mistakes that I have made are proper examples of what I need to focus on as I continue my journey. I have had great difficulty understanding the best way to use the flexboxes, so many of my contents do not yet look how I aspire for them to present.

The functionality of my images as links, while fun, is definitely not yet grasped. 

The most important lesson I need to take away from this project (and its many failures along the way), is how to adapt to changing code and mistakes. While I felt confident with my starter code, I realized that the semantic tags I used needed to be reworked, which in turn created a mess in my stylesheet (attempting to attach styles to the correct tags, having a more thorough wireframe design so I can better predict challenges, etc.).

All in all, I look forward to using this experience to better my portfolio and my design skills.
